### Modified
- Only for very niche use case (used with [No Reload Mod Manager Custom Lib Version](https://github.com/Aglglg/No-Reload-Mod-Manager/tree/for-custom-xxmi-lib))
#### What changed?
- Background/foreground check now using `target` and or `manager` if specified in `[Loader]`
- Added `manager_if-manager_endif` to avoid mod cannot be managed/overlapped because there's an error in default conditional syntax.
